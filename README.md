### 🚀Getting Started
---
Install frontend dependencies

```
cd ./client && npm install
```
Install backend dependencies
```
cd ./server && npm install
```
#### Setup .env File
First you need a AWS IAM account with cognito pool and s3 bucket. you could call your cognito pool & s3 bucket whatever the name you want. just make sure to update appropriate values on .env file.

I'm using mongodb cloud as the database. you can easily setup your mongodb account by visiting to this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/)

```
MONGO_USER=
MONGO_PASSWORD=
AWS_REGION=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

AWS_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID=
AWS_USER_POOL_ID=
```
